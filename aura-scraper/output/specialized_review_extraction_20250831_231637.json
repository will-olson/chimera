Looker's great for data, but I really wish it had more advanced and complex chart types built-in. Sometimes, for really specific visuals, I have to export data or use other tools, which isn't ideal. While you can build custom visuals, it's not as straightforward as I'd like, and the standard options feel a bit basic for telling richer data stories.",
