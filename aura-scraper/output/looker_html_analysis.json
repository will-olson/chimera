For any company where GCP is their main source of ground truth, it is best choice but if you have equal possibility of using alternatives, there might be better options in the market as well.ProsIt was very easy implementation and linking the data to GCP. It was used as the dashboard tool both for internal(marketing and business) and external(clients) teams. UI was user friendly and easy to set up.ConsThere were a few bugs and issues with the dashboard. Some was that there were discrepancies between the main database and GCP, which resulted in missing data in the final dashboard.Review sourceContinue readingJMJames M.Client Partner DirectorInformation Technology and Services\"A Rich Tool Sometimes Overlooked Compared to Competition\"4.0August 4, 2025ProsLooker is a rich and easy to use platform.  It supports a lot of great connections and building visualizations or modifying them is intuitive.ConsGoogle Organizations and Google Groups on occasion can be confusing as you manage the organization of or cleanse access to Looker dashboards.Review sourceContinue readingCBChristoph B.COOHospitality\"Versatile and one size solution for data analytics\"4.0July 29, 2025self-service and easy to use for the teams - difficult to churn away from because of the easy handling by the teams.ProsVersatility to self program and apply analytics with various data warehouse structures. Also bug fixing and changes in data structures can easily be understood by teams without customer support involvement.ConsSome visual representations are falling behind the competitors. This especially plays a role when making the visuals fit / scrolling for various screens.Review sourceContinue readingALAlexandra L.Customer success managerMarketing and Advertising\"My go-to for client reports\"3.0July 16, 2025Once you understand the system, it gets easy to use and it’s very flexible. At the moment I am delivering 200 monthly reports with this source, works great and is reliable.ProsThe reports are very customable, you can design a report almost as if you were working in power point. Like a drag-and-drop of different type of charts, and everything is connected to the sources you integrate.ConsIt takes time to understand the tool, the resources integration can be confusing when you start using it. Also many useful charts are not available unless you install extensions. Would be also good if you could connect more resources than just Google ones, for example Facebook or linked in, without having to pay a third party for this solution.Switched fromSemrushWhatagraphWe needed something more accurate and more customizable. Also a cheaper solution with more options.Review sourceContinue readingJLJames L.Product ManagementHealth, Wellness and Fitness\"Looker is a solid BI tool\"5.0May 31, 2025Overall, I've had a really good time with Looker. It's a solid BI platform that truly shines in how it handles data and lets people help themselves. LookML is a game-changer for keeping our data clean and empowering users. It's totally helped us understand our data better. Even though I sometimes wish for cooler native charts, Looker's flexibility and data modeling capabilities definitely make up for it. It's a fantastic choice if you need a powerful and adaptable BI tool.ProsLooker's flexibility is awesome, especially with its LookML modeling. It means we define our business logic once, and it's consistent everywhere. This makes it super easy for anyone to dig into the data without needing to know complex code. Plus, quickly creating new reports and drilling down is a breeze. Version control for LookML is also a huge win for teamwork!ConsMy main gripe is with the visualizations. Looker's great for data, but I really wish it had more advanced and complex chart types built-in. Sometimes, for really specific visuals, I have to export data or use other tools, which isn't ideal. While you can build custom visuals, it's not as straightforward as I'd like, and the standard options feel a bit basic for telling richer data stories.Review sourceContinue readingLSLaura S.SDRFinancial Services\"Great dashboard tool\"4.0May 18, 2025Great tool to have all the organizational data in a visual dashboard to interpret, we mainly use it to compare sales objetives vs results, and evolutionsProsIt is a great tool to visualize data, from results to objetives, evolutions, etcConsIt is sometimes a little bit slow to charge the dashboardsReview sourceContinue readingMSMara S.Head of MarketingMarketing and Advertising\"Okay product for data visualisation\"3.0April 27, 2025Good product if you are looking for a free data visualisation tool.
