# Enhanced Head-to-Head Comparison Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of enhanced head-to-head comparison scraping capabilities in the Chimera Scraper system. The implementation focuses on **AI-generated summary extraction** as the primary competitive intelligence target, while also capturing comprehensive additional data sections found lower on G2.com comparison pages.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Core Components

1. **Enhanced Parser**: `src/chimera/parsers/head_to_head_comparison.py`
2. **Specialized Scraper**: `src/chimera/core/head_to_head_comparison_scraper.py`
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into `competitive_intelligence_scraper.py`

## Primary Focus: AI-Generated Summary Extraction

### What We Capture

The system specifically targets and extracts the **AI-generated summaries** that appear on G2.com head-to-head comparison pages. These summaries are particularly valuable as they represent dynamic, synthesized insights from user reviews.

#### AI Summary Data Structure

```python
@dataclass
class AIGeneratedSummary:
    summary_title: str                    # "AI Generated Summary"
    summary_subtitle: str                 # "AI-generated. Powered by real user reviews."
    summary_points: List[Dict[str, Any]]  # Individual summary points
    extraction_confidence: float          # Confidence in extraction
    structured_insights: Dict[str, Any]   # Analyzed competitive insights
```

#### Summary Point Analysis

Each summary point is parsed to extract:

- **Competitive Scores**: Numerical ratings (e.g., "scoring 9.2 compared to 8.7")
- **Feature Categories**: Data visualization, ease of setup, AI capabilities, etc.
- **Insight Types**: Competitive advantage, disadvantage, or comparative analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive, negative, or neutral
- **Confidence Metrics**: Extraction confidence based on data quality

### Example AI Summary Extraction

**Input Text:**
> "Users report that Microsoft Power BI excels in data visualization, scoring 9.2 compared to Domo's 8.7. Reviewers mention that Power BI's interactive dashboards and rich visualizations make it easier to derive insights from data."

**Structured Output:**
```json
{
  "text": "Users report that Microsoft Power BI excels in data visualization...",
  "product_a_score": 8.7,
  "product_b_score": 9.2,
  "feature_category": "data visualization",
  "insight_type": "competitive_advantage",
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "confidence": 90.0
}
```

### Confidence Calculation

```python
def _calculate_point_confidence(self, text: str, score_a: Optional[float], score_b: Optional[float]) -> float:
    confidence = 0.0
    
    # Base confidence from text quality
    if len(text) > 100: confidence += 30
    elif len(text) > 50: confidence += 20
    
    # Confidence from score extraction
    if score_a is not None and score_b is not None: confidence += 40
    
    # Confidence from structured data
    if any(word in text.lower() for word in ["scoring", "compared", "versus"]): confidence += 20
    
    # Confidence from feature identification
    if self._extract_feature_category(text) != "other": confidence += 10
    
    return min(confidence, 100.0)
```
